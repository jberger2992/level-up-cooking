            <p>Level-Up Cooking is a show that brings two of my passions in life together Cooking and Gaming. I have been in kitchens for 20 years and have been gaming almost my whole life. I know that for me the fast paced life of a culinary professional can get stressful, I have always used video games to counter that stress. Whether it be Elder Scrolls, Call of Duty, Donkey Kong, Mario, Sonic, even as far back as Tetris, I have always found games to ease my mind after a rough day! Many of my friends in game and IRL always ask me about cooking, so I figure why not combine the 2 to inspire gamers to get in their kitchen and learn some video game based recipes. This way they can eat good food that is also interesting to them based off their love of games, instead of always ordering take out or just snacks! I hope you guys enjoy this show and it helps to get you in the kitchen and enjoy food on a whole other level. That way not only are you leveling up on your favorite video game, but you're also leveling up your skills in the kitchen!!!!</p>
